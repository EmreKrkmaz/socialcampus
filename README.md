# Social Campus
My first MERN stack app.

>>Website deployed on HEROKU. You can visit the website via : https://socialcampus0.herokuapp.com

>>In this website you can create posts and make CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations on posts. You can also comment on posts and like posts. When you click on a post, website recommends you the posts you would also like.

>>In order to deploy the project on heroku, folder structure is a bit different. Except of the client folder which consist front-end codes, every folder and file consist back-end codes.
